## Abstract
This project develops an advanced recipe recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions to enhance user experience. By combining **sentiment analysis**, **collaborative filtering**, and **content-based filtering**, the system delivers relevant recipes based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and past interactions. Integration of textual reviews and numerical ratings ensures accurate, engaging, and customized recommendations.

## Overview
Hybrid Recipe Recommendation System providing personalized recipe suggestions based on user preferences, dietary needs, and review sentiment, leveraging machine learning and deep learning for enhanced user experience.

## Features
- Personalized recipe recommendations
- Collaborative filtering using SVD
- Content-based filtering using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Sentiment analysis using RNN/LSTM
- Hybrid model combining multiple recommendation techniques

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Power BI for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
- Git and GitHub for version control
  
## System Architecture
The system consists of the following modules:
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** ‚Äì Collects recipe data, user ratings, and reviews; cleans and transforms the data.
2. **Collaborative Filtering** ‚Äì Suggests recipes based on user-item interactions using SVD.
3. **Content-Based Filtering** ‚Äì Suggests recipes based on similarity of recipe features using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
4. **Sentiment Analysis** ‚Äì Analyzes textual reviews using RNN/LSTM to capture user preferences.
5. **Hybrid Recommendation Model** ‚Äì Combines outputs from all models to provide final recommendations.
6. **Visualization & Reporting** ‚Äì Uses Power BI for insights and interactive dashboards.
